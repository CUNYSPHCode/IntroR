# Let's learn about R and RStudio!

## The R Language

### R

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It
compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

<sup>
This tutorial was adapted from the
[RStudio website](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r).

```{r quiz2, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Questions",
  question("Is R free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "R is free _and_ open source, which means that anyone can read, use, and copy the source code of the R language."),
    answer("No.")
  ),
  question("Where do you download R?",
    answer("www.rstudio.com/download"),
    answer("[cloud.r-project.org](http://cloud.r-project.org)", correct = TRUE, message = "You can also download R from [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org)"),
    answer("www.r-project.org", message = "Good try, but not exactly. www.r-project.org doesn't provide a download link, but it does provide a link to one the websites above."),
    answer("www.r.com"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How often should you update R?",
    answer("Everytime you use it", message = "This will be too often unless you use R very rarely!"),
    answer("About once a year", correct = TRUE, "A new version of R is released about once a year. Update sooner if you encounter a bug that you cannot explain."),
    answer("Never", message = "A new version of R is released about once a year. I'll assume that you are using the newest version of R, which will be the fastest version with the fewest unexpected behaviors." ),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## RStudio

### What is R Studio?

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment for R. What does that mean?
Well, if you think of R as a language, which it is, you can think of RStudio as
a program that helps you write and work in the language. RStudio makes
programming in R much easier and I suggest that you use it!

```{r quiz3, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - What is RStudio?",
  question("What is the RStudio IDE?",
    answer("An application that makes it easier to use R.", correct = TRUE, message = "RStudio organizes your workspace and makes it easier to write, use, debug, and save R code. I highly recommend it and will rely on the RStudio IDE in several tutorials."),
    answer("An application that let's you use R without writing any code", message = "And thank goodness! Code provides a reproducible record of your work, which is essential for data science."),
    answer("A spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel."),
    answer("Another name for R", message = "R and RStudio are two separate things. R is a language, like English. Think of RStudio as a program that helps you use the language, kind of like how a word processing program helps you write in English."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Is the RStudio IDE free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features in these tutorials."),
    answer("No.", message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features in these tutorials.")
  ),
  question("Where do you download RStudio?",
    answer("www.rstudio.com/download", correct = TRUE, message = "For these tutorials, download and install the RStudio Desktop Open Source License."),
    answer("[cloud.r-project.org](http://cloud.r-project.org)", message = "This is where you download R, not RStudio."),
    answer("www.r-project.org"),
    answer("[cran.rstudio.org](http://cran.rstudio.org)"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Do you need to install R if you already have RStudio?",
    answer("Yes.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No.", message = "R does not come with RStudio; you need to install R separately.")
  )

```{r names, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - Working with Packages",

    answer("`library()`", message = "We will see what `library()` does later."),
    answer("`install.packages()`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`install_packages()`"),
    answer("There is no command. You must visit [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org) and download packages manually.", message = "R makes it easy to download packages. You connect to the internet and then run one of the commands above."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How often do you need to install a package on your computer?",
    answer("Every time you restart R"),
    answer("Every time you restart your computer"),
    answer("Only once. Afterwards, R can find it on your hard drive as needed.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Never, as long as you are connected to the internet.", message = "This could be true if you are using R over a cloud service. However, if you are using R locally on your own computer, you will need to install each package that you use on your computer."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What is the tidyverse?",
    answer("A collection of packages that work well together and provide tools for common data science tasks.", correct = TRUE, message = 'You can install all of the tidyverse packages at once with `install.packages("tidyverse")`.'),
    answer("A word processing program for R"),
    answer("A code style that reads like poetry"),
