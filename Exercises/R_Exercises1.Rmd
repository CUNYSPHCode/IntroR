## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
"Hello World"
```

## R as a calculator: calculatoR

Here are some common operations that R can do.
Type some in your R console to try them out.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
5 + 2
5 - 2
5 * 2
5 / 2
```

### Exponentiation
```{r}
5 ^ 2
5 ** 2
```

### Modulus (remainder)
```{r}
5 %% 2
```

### Divisor (integer division)
```{r}
5 %/% 2
```

### Combining numbers

```{r}
c(1, 3, 4, 5)
```

### Sequences

```{r}
1:10
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)
```

### The `mean` function

```{r}
mean(c(2,3,6))
```

## Questions

1. Look at the help documentation for the `class` function. How many arguments
can be passed to it?

```{r}
?class
## only one argument
```

2. Pull up the help documentation for the `mean` function. What does the `Value`
section say this function returns?

```{r}
?mean
## arithmetic mean
```
