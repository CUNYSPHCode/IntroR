## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
"Hello World"
```

## File extensions

* Tell the computer how to read a file. 
* The file extension for RMarkdown files is `.Rmd` and for R scripts
is `.R`. 
* Check your operating system configurations for how to make these visible.

With this in mind, the name of this file in R is a single character-type string:

```{r}
"R_Exercises1.Rmd"
```

## File paths

* File paths differ in appearance by system
* There are two types of file paths
  * relative
  * absolute

In RMarkdown files, the easiest to use is the _relative_ file path,
when the file is in the **same** folder as the `.Rmd` file.

A file path is relative because it is in reference to a _current_ working
directory. To know what directory is the current one in R, use:

```{r}
getwd()
```

Not that the return of this function is a single character-type string with
the foward slashes (denoting folders). We expect a path to a folder from 
`getwd()`.

### Relative

Therefore a relative file path in this directory would look like this:

```{r}
"R_Exercises.Rmd"
```

It can also look like this:

```{r}
"./R_Exercises1.Rmd"
```

The `.` in a path always represents the current working directory.

### Absolute

The absolute file path is comprised of the full path to the current working
directory and the file or folder name.

### Try it

Use `file.choose()` to get an absolute path printed in the console after
selecting a file.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
file.choose()
```

The result of this operation when we choose the current `.Rmd` file looks like
this:

```{r}
"C:\\Users\\SPHStaff\\Documents\\Courses\\IntroR\\Exercises\\R_Exercises1.Rmd"
```

On Windows, we either use the double blackslash or a single forward slash
to separate folders.

## R as a calculator: calculatoR

Here are some common operations that R can do.
Type some in your R console to try them out.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
5 + 2
5 - 2
5 * 2
5 / 2
```

### Exponentiation
```{r}
5 ^ 2
5 ** 2
```

### Modulus (remainder)
```{r}
5 %% 2
```

### Divisor (integer division)
```{r}
5 %/% 2
```

### Combining numbers

```{r}
c(1, 3, 4, 5)
( c(1, 3, 4, 5) + 10 ) / 2
```

```{r}
(1 + 10) / 2
(3 + 10) / 2
(4 + 10) / 2
(5 + 10) / 2
```

### Sequences

```{r}
1:10
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)
```

### Try it out

What is 8 plus 2? 

```{r}

```


### The `mean` function

```{r}
mean(   c(2,3,6)   )
```

R is case sensitive. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# this is an error
MEAN(1:10)
```

## Questions

1. Look at the help documentation for the `class` function. How many arguments
can be passed to it?

```{r}
?class
## only one argument

help("class")
```

2. Pull up the help documentation for the `mean` function. What does the `Value`
section say this function returns?

```{r}
?mean
## arithmetic mean
help(topic = "mean")
```
