**Note**: Use `Ctrl (Command) + Alt (Option) + I` or go to `Code` >
`Insert Chunk` (from the menu) to insert a code block "chunk". 

## Exercises

1. Look at the documentation for the `rep` function. 
**Note:** Before writing anything in the console, try to guess on paper what the
function call will look like.

Now, use the `rep` function to output the following vectors to the R console:

a) 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
b) 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2
c) 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9

2. Write a character vector with your 3 favorite food items and assign it to an
object called `myFaves`.

```{r}

```

3. Create a factor from the `myFaves` character vector. 

```{r}

```

4. Create an ordered factor from the `myFaves` character vector by arranging
the levels argument in the order from least to greatest in personal preference. 

```{r}

```

5. Load the `mtcars` dataset by running the `data()` function on it. How many
columns does the data have? How many rows? What function do you use to look at
the car makes and models?

```{r}

```

6. Use a series of **20** random numbers with a mean of **20** and a standard
deviation of **5** to create a matrix with **4** rows.

```{r}

```

7. Create a list of 2 vectors (a character vector of letters a, b, and c and a
numeric vector from one to ten) with names `element1` and `element2`.

```{r}

```
