## Completing the assignment

Check your work by knitting the document.

1. Create a level 2 header below in Markdown with the name "Answer 1".



2. Add an unordered Markdown list of your favorite food dishes and
add their ingredients as sub-items in the list. You should enter at least two
dishes with two ingredients each.


3. Insert an R code chunk below. Show the `summary` of the `Orange` dataset.
Run a linear regression using the `lm` function to predict `circumference` from
`age` and assign the result. Show the `summary` of the fit object that you
assigned.


4. Add an RMarkdown weblink (in link format) below to your favorite R reference
website.


5. Replace the author field in the `yaml` header with your name and then
successfully `knit` the RMarkdown document into a Word document.


6. Load the `mtcars` dataset. Summarize the average miles per gallon (`mpg`) per
cylinder category in the data. Note. Remember to use code chunks for R code.
