# Notes on last week's lecture

* Using `c()` with mixed data types
* `...` ellipses
    * additional arguments to "lower level" functions 
    (e.g., `par()` in `plot()`)
* Any questions?

# Brief recap

* Basic features of the language
    * interactive and _interpreted_
    * case sensitive, ignores spaces except between objects and functions
    * an object is any type of variable stored in R (i.e., `data.frame`, `numeric` vector, `function`, etc.)
    * Be familiar with the parts of a function
    * know your help pages (use `?functionname` or `help("functionname")`)
    * Finding help and troubleshooting are critically important
    * Help pages can be intimidating but very useful

# Today's lecture overview

* Importing and Exporting Data
* Classes and Data types in R
    * `data.frame`
    * data type coercion
* Subsetting
    * using brackets and dollar signs (`[`, `$`)
    * using vector operands
* More troubleshooting

# Importing and Exporting Data

* Recognizing file types
    * File extensions (e.g., `.tsv`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.sav`, `.sasb7dat`)
* Show file extensions on Windows
    * Windows Start button > Control panel > (View by: Large Icons) > Folder options > View tab > Advanced Settings: [__Deselect__] Hide extensions for known file types
* Downloading files from the internet

# Packages for reading foreign data

* readr, readxl, haven

# Exporting Data

* `write.table()`
* `write.csv()` / `write_csv()`
* `write_delim()`

# Classes in R

# What are classes?

* R objects have class attributes 
* Define what functions/operations can be performed
* `class()` function
* Examples

# Vectors, classes, and functions

* Vectors of class (may be named):
    * character, integer, numeric, logical, complex, raw (bytes)
    * factor: discrete levels
        * mostly used in regressions
        * set reference by `relevel`ing categories 
        * `relevel` does not work with ordered factors
    * missing (`NA`)
* Tabular classes: 
    * `data.frame`
    * `matrix`
* Non-tabular: 
    * `function`
    * `list`
    * `array`
    * custom classes
