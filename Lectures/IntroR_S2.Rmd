## Notes on last week's lecture

* Using `c()` with mixed data types
* `...` ellipses
    * additional arguments to "lower level" functions 
    (e.g., `par()` in `plot()`)
* Any questions?

## Brief recap

* Basic features of the language
    * case sensitive, ignores spaces except between objects and functions
    * an object is any type of variable stored in R (i.e., `data.frame`, `numeric` vector, `function`, etc.)
    * Be familiar with the parts of a function
    * know your help pages (use `?functionname` or `help("functionname")`)
