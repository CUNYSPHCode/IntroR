# Notes on last week's lecture

* Using `c()` with mixed data types
* `...` ellipses
    * additional arguments to "lower level" functions 
    (e.g., `par()` in `plot()`)
* '+' in the console indicates 'waiting for additional input...'
* relative vs absolute paths
    * when to use them?
* Any questions?

# Brief recap

* Basic features of the language
    * interactive and _interpreted_
        * commands are entered in the console / via script
        * the commands are pre-processed in some way before evaluation
    * case sensitive, ignores spaces except between objects and functions
    * an object is any type of variable stored in R (i.e., `data.frame`, `numeric` vector, `function`, etc.)
    * Be familiar with the parts of a function
        * function name, argument, inputs
    * know your help pages (use `?functionname` or `help("functionname")`)
    * Finding help and troubleshooting are critically important
        * check for examples online
        * ask on the #rstats Slack channel
    * Help pages can be intimidating but useful

# Today's lecture overview

* Importing and Exporting Data
* Classes and Data types in R
    * `data.frame`
    * data type coercion
* Subsetting
    * using brackets and dollar signs (`[`, `$`)
    * using vector operands
* More troubleshooting

# Importing and Exporting Data

* Recognizing file types
    * File extensions (e.g., `.tsv`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.sav`, `.sasb7dat`)
* Show file extensions on Windows
    * Windows File Explorer > View tab > Show File Extensions 
* Downloading files from the internet
    * `read.csv()`
    * `download.file()`

# Packages for reading foreign data

* readr, readxl, haven
* readr - provides fast and efficient read-in for large files
* readxl - allows you to read MS Excel files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`)
* haven - support for SPSS, SAS, and other data

# Exporting Data

* `write.table()`
* `write.csv()` / `write_csv()`
* `write_delim()`

# Classes in R

![Bicycle](bicycle-34159_960_720.png)

# What are classes?

* R objects have class attributes 
* Define what functions/operations can be performed
* `class()` function
* Examples

# Vectors, classes, and functions

* Vectors of class (may be named):
    * character, integer, numeric, logical, complex, raw (bytes)
    * factor: discrete levels
        * mostly used in regressions
        * set reference by `relevel`ing categories 
        * `relevel` does not work with ordered factors
    * missing (`NA`)
* Tabular classes: 
    * `data.frame`
    * `matrix`
* Non-tabular: 
    * `function`
    * `list`
    * `array`
    * custom classes

# list

* Handle multiple data types in one
* Can contain vectors, data.frames, and even functions
* The `data.frame` is a special type of list

# data.frame

* A unique type of list with uniform lengths in all elements
* Great for data analysis
* Most common class you will use to do analysis

# matrix

* can handle only one type of data at a time
* can be character or numeric
* create using `matrix()` function

# tibble

* custom tabular data class
* 'tidyverse' representation of a data.frame
* a neat print output
* metadata on the columns (chr, int, etc.)

# Type (class) coercion

* as.__*(class type here)*__
* `as.character`
* `as.numeric`
* `as.logical`
* `as.data.frame`
* `as_tibble` (in 'tibble' package)

# Exploratory functions on a data.frame

* head
* tail
* dim
* colnames
* rownames
* sapply(x, class)
