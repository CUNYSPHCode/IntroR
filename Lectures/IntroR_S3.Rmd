# Notes on the Thursday's lecture

* Changing the levels of a factor
* converting factors to numeric
* data classes: lists and matrices
* Up arrow in RStudio
* RMarkdown basics

# Recap

* Import and Export data
    * Know your paths!
    * Most export functions include keyword "write" (i.e., `write.table`)
* Classes (bicycle analogy)
    * can have particular operations
    * some functions are similar across classes
    * identify a class by using the `class` function
* Factors and levels
* `data.frames` and `lists`
* subsetting using vectors
    * Accessing columns with `[` and `$`
* coercion (`as.`**classname**)

# Data Manipulation Overview

* Subsetting (cont.)
    * vectors and `[` with character, numeric, logical
    * `lists` and `[` / `$`
    * double brackets `[[`
    * with conditions
* Sorting and aggregating data
* removing duplicated records
* removing records with `NA`
* merging and binding
* transformations
