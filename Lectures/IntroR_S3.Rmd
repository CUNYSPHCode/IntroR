# Notes on the Thursday's lecture

* assignment operator `<-` (in English: "gets")
* extract vector from `data.frame` with `$`
* converting between data types (e.g., `as.numeric`)
  * a.k.a. coercion (`as.`**classname**)
* importing and exporting data
  * read and write functions
* general data categories: tabular / non-tabular (unstructured)
* class names: vector, list, and matrix

# Lists

# Notes on Thursday's lecture (cont.)

* generating random numbers and matrix
* Up arrow in RStudio
* more on RMarkdown

# Recap

* Classes (bicycle analogy)
    * can have particular operations
    * some functions (methods) are similar across classes
    * identify a class by using the `class` function
* Assignment creates objects and puts them in the `.GlobalEnv` (see `ls()`)
* Factors and levels
    * Changing the levels of a factor
* `data.frames` and `lists`
* Import and Export data
    * Know your paths!
    * Most export functions include "write" (i.e., `write.table`)
    * Most import functions include "read" (i.e., `read.csv`)
    * Use relative paths for Rmd files
        * Put the data and file in the same folder
    * You can use absolute paths for interactive sessions (console)
* subsetting using vectors
    * Accessing rows and columns with `[`
    * Extract a vector with `$`
* R Exercise 1 and 2

# Motivation

![](ronnieheavyweight.jpg)

# Motivation (cont.)

* Learning R requires practice (doing)
* Persistence
* Find fun exercises (Trello Board)
* Follow along with the live coding examples
* Enjoy it!

# Expectations

![](radvicetwitter.png)

# Expectations (cont.)

* Exposure to the R language
  * vocabulary and common verbs
* Basics of troubleshooting and debugging
  * Using examples, documentation
* Learning R won't happen overnight

# Data Manipulation Overview

* Inspecting a data.frame
    * dimension
    * rownames, colnames
    * head
* Subsetting (cont.)
    * vectors and `[` with character, numeric, logical
    * `lists` and `[` / `$`
    * double bracket extraction `[[`
    * using conditions
* Sorting and aggregating data
* removing duplicated records
* removing records with `NA`
* merging and binding
* transformations

# Subsetting

* Reduce dimensionality of data (rows or columns)
* can be done with either the `[` bracket or tidyverse operations
* Think about dimensions before doing the subset
* Think in terms of verbs (slice, select)
* Draw it out!
* `$` extracts a vector from a `data.frame`
* `[[` extracts and reduces to a single vector where possible from a
`data.frame` or `list`
* conditions help us specify what parts of the data we want
    * `sex == "males"`
    * `age >= 18`

# Sorting and aggregating data

* `order` function - returns an index of ordered positions
* tidyverse equivalent: `arrange` - returns the arranged data

# Formula notation in R

* Uses the `~` for denoting a formula
    * `y ~ m*x + b`
* Good for working with statistical models / tables
* Mainly used in base R code
* Useful for creating crosstabs!
    * `xtabs(A ~ B, data = blue)`
* Look out for `formula` class inputs
    * see `?xtabs`
    * see `?t.test`
* Functions with `formula` inputs usually have a `data` argument
    * R needs to know where the variables can be found

# Useful conditions for subsetting

* Removing duplicated rows
    * `duplicated` on a `data.frame`
* Removing records with `NA`
    * `is.na` to get a logical vector

# Merging and Binding

* `merge` function
    * takes two `data.frame`s as input
    * arguments tell it how to merge
    * see example
* `cbind` and `rbind`
    * concatenate by columns or rows
    * `rbind`: names in columns must match
    * `cbind`: number of rows must match
* Creating bins from continuous variables
    * `Hmisc::cut2` - easy way to create categories from numeric variables
* Tidyverse
    * `join` construct
    * see RStudio cheatsheet

# Transformations / Manipulations

* long to wide format
* `dplyr` and `reshape2` packages
* `aggregate` / `group_by`

# Discussion

* Working with data
    * Tools at your disposal
    * String together functions to reach a desired outcome
    * Add comments to code to explain steps
* Recognize how data should be represented
    * long - longitudinal data
    * wide - survey data
* Recognize what data format is best for visualization
    * ggplot2 may want long data
