# Reporting Tools

* Reproducibility is a major issue across disciplines[^1]
* Being able to reproduce your _own_ analysis is essential
* Reviewers may ask to redo your analysis with slight modifications
* "Future" you will _thank you_ for creating an analysis workflow that
is easy to follow and well annotated
* R Markdown is an essential tool for effective communication and
dissemination of reproducible results
