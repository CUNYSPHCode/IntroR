# Announcements

* Review Exercise 4 in class

# Topics to review

* `install.packages` vs `library`
    * `install.packages` - run in the console once (if successful)
        * downloads the package from the internet and **installs** it
        * _installation_ does not make the functions immediately available!
    * `library` - makes functions available in a package by **loading** it
* Notes for using RMarkdown
    * `install.packages` - installation needed once only, install via the
    _console_
    * do not include `install.packages` in the RMarkdown file
    * do not include help functions in the code, that's FYI only
    * load a package using `library("pkgname")` before using its functions
    * loading makes the functions available for use

# Topics to review (2)

* Make use of the example code
    * `library(dplyr); mtcars %>% ...`
* Settings in RStudio
    * Default to plot inline
    * Plot in plotting window (more space)
    * Change the settings in Tools > Global Options > RMarkdown
* Avoid `attach()`!
    * Creates a mess of your global environment

# Code reading practice

* See `inClass_S5.R` file
    * First create a linear model from variables
    * Use `broom::tidy` on linear model object
    * Add a couple of columns using the `mutate` function
    * Remove teams that are missing using `is.na` and restrict to 2015
    * Reorder teams by some metric `estimate` and use `geom_pointrange`
    * Flip coordinates and add some labels
* Don't worry about the specifics
* Understand the gist of what is happening
* Use what we know to look up functions: `?`, `help`, Google

# Today's lecture topics

* Plotting Systems
    * Types of graphs
    * `ggplot2`
    * Saving outputs
* Repetitive code
    * `for` loops
    * Functions
    * Functionals and functional programming
        * `apply` family

# Plotting systems in R

* Three main systems:
    * 'Base' graphics
        * Already installed with R
    * lattice
        * Less common
    * ggplot2
        * Most popular
        * Syntax is different

# Exploratory Data Analysis

* Informal representation data
* Looking for patterns, outliers, etc.
* Getting familiar with your data!

# Types of graphs

* Historgram
* Scatterplot
    * Scatterplot matrix
* Boxplots / dotplots (`ggplot2`)
* Violin plots (`ggplot2`)
* Q-Q plots
* Mosaic plots
* and many more!

# `ggplot2` - Grammar of Graphics

* Different syntax
    * Slight learning curve
* Plots are built in layers
* Operations add layers to the plot

# Saving outputs

* Common formats for saving plots:
    * PDF
    * SVG
    * PNG/TIFF
* but there are more
* `ggsave`

# Output sandwhich

* Start with a function `pdf`, `png`, `jpeg`, etc.

![](2012-r-xl-vegetable-sandwich-with-dill-sauce.jpg){ width=50% }

* End in `dev.off()` for closing the graphics window

# Saving plots in `ggplot2`

* `ggplot2` graphics require a `print` (or a call) before it gets rendered in
the file.
* `ggsave` - added to make it easier to save plotting objects

# Repetitive operations

* What strategies work to reduce the amount of repetitive coding?
    * `for` loops
    * `function`
* Instances where you might repeat code
    * Replacing missing values with `NA`
    * Data cleaning operations
* When to use a `for` loop / `lapply`
    * When you want to apply a series of operations more than once
* When to write a `function`
    * When you run a series of operations more than once

# `for` loops

* Repeat code a certain number of times
* Usually reserved for simple operations
* `for` <_variable_> in <_sequence of numbers_> { operation }
* Each step is visible
* Purpose of the loop may not be immediately clear

# Functions

* Main mechanism for extending the language
  * Packages make these portable
* Group operations for _ideally_ one purpose
* _Pure_ functions - input is the same class as the output
* Well defined inputs and outputs (usually)

# Functionals

* An argument that itself is a function
* Many functions can accept other functions as an arguments
  * lapply
  * tapply
  * summarize
* Make coding more efficient and customizeable
* Increased flexibility but add a layer of complexity
* Why use them?
  * To avoid loops and simplify code
