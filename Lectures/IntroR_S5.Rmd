# Announcements

* Exercise 4
* Next week (conference)

# Notes on Thursday's lecture

* [\color{blue}{Interactivity}](http://mramos.shinyapps.io/obView)
* Plotting Odds Ratios
    * Base graphics
    * ggplot2

# Review

* Notes on RMarkdown format
    * `install.packages` - installation needed once only, install via the
    console
* Settings in RStudio
    * Default to plot inline
    * Plot in plotting window (more space)
* Plotting systems in R
    * base, lattice, ggplot2
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Graphics device
    * the default window / pane for all your plots
    * save to external files (`pdf`, `png`, etc.)

# Code reading practice

* See `inClass_S5.R` file
    * First create a linear model from variables
    * Use `broom::tidy` on linear model object
    * Add a couple of columns using the `mutate` function
    * Remove teams that are missing using `is.na` and restrict to 2015
    * Reorder teams by some metric `estimate` and use `geom_pointrange`
    * Flip coordinates and add some labels

# Today's lecture topics

* Repetitive code
* `for` loops
* Functions
* Functionals and functional programming
    * `apply` family

# Examples

* Generate data using `replicate` and `sample` functions
* Replacing missing values with `NA`
* When to use a `for` loop
* When to write a `function`

# `for` loops

* Repeat code a certain number of times
* Usually reserved for simple operations
* `for` <_variable_> in <_sequence of numbers_> { operation }
* Each step is visible
* Purpose may not be immediately clear

# Functions

* Extend the language
    * Portable
* Group operations for _ideally_ one purpose
* _Pure_ functions
* Well defined inputs and output (usually)

# Functionals

* An argument that itself is a function
* Many functions can accept other functions as an arguments
    * lapply
* Make coding more efficient and customizeable
* Increased flexibility but add a layer of complexity
* Why use them? 
    * To avoid loops and simplify code
