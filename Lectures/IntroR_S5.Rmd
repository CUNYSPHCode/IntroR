# Announcements

# Today's lecture topics

* Repetitive code
* `for` loops
* Functions
* Functionals and functional programming
    * `apply` family

# Examples

* Replacing missing values with NA
* Using a `for` loop
* Using a `function`

# `for` loops

* Repeat code a certain number of times
* `for` <_variable_> in <_sequence of numbers_> {  }
* Each step is visible
* Purpose may not be immediately clear

# Functions

* Extend the language
* Group operations for _ideally_ one purpose
* _Pure_ functions

# Functionals

* An argument that itself is a function
* Many functions can accept other functions as an arguments
* Make coding more efficient and customizeable
