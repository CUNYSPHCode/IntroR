# Today's lecture topics

* Repetitive code
* `for` loops
* Functions
* Functionals and functional programming
    `apply` family

# Examples

* Replacing missing values with NA
* Using a `for` loop
* Using a `function`

# `for` loops

* Repeat code a certain number of times
* `for` <_variable_> in <_sequence of numbers_> {  }

* Group operations for _ideally_ one purpose
* _Pure_ function

# Functionals

* A function that takes another function as an argument
