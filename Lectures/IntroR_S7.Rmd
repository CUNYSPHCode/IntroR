# Notes from previous class

* `t-test` with a formula vs vector
* object names with a period (`.`)
* apply over a `data.frame`

# General R Learning Tips

* Troubleshooting is important
    * Know your errors
* Know your inputs and your outputs
* Practice, practice, practice
* Make use of online resources, help pages
* Be curious
    * test your questions with examples

# Troubleshooting

* Getting help within R
    * Documentation pages (examples)
* Getting help outside of R
    * stackoverflow.com
    * Quick-R website
* Running code line by line
    * Identify where in the script the error is occuring
    * Isolate the issue by breaking the process into small pieces

# Exploring objects

* `head` & `tail`
* `class`
* `length` or `dim`
* `dimnames`
* `attributes`
* `str`
* `args` on a function name

# Catalogue

* Create a catalog of functions that are useful for a particular task
* Use your reference websites / textbooks
    * R Cookbook by Winston Chang - ggplot2
    * Quick-R
    * R for Data Science - Hadley Wickham
    * Handbook for Statistical Analyses using R - 3rd Ed.

# Data Analysis Workflow

* RStudio setup
* import
* clean
    * subset / divide
* reshape
* summarize
* explore
* graph
* report
