# Notes from previous class

* `lm` and friends
* `t-test` with a formula vs vector
* object names with a period (`.`)
* 'apply'ing over a `data.frame`

# Today's outline

* General Tips
* Troubleshooting
* Exploratory functions
* GitHub basics
* Data Analysis Workflow

# General R Learning Tips

* Effective troubleshooting is important
    * Get familiar with errors
    * Stack Overflow
    * Helping others on Slack
* Keep inputs and outputs in mind
* Practice, practice, practice
    * Mock examples
    * Answer your own questions in the console
    * Search for answers online
    * Follow online example by running them
* Make use of online resources, help pages
    * RStudio cheatsheets
* Create a catalog...

# Catalog

* Create a catalog of functions that are useful for a particular task
* Use your reference websites / textbooks
    * [R Cookbook by Winston Chang](https://r-graphics.org/)
    * [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/)
    * [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - Hadley Wickham
    * Handbook for Statistical Analyses using R - 3rd Ed.

# Troubleshooting

* Getting help within R
    * Documentation pages (examples)
* Getting help outside of R
    * stackoverflow.com
        * Reproducible examples `reprex::reprex`
    * Quick-R website
* Finding the error in the code
    * Run code line by line to identify location
    * Isolate the error by breaking the process into small pieces

# Exploring an object

* `head` & `tail`
* `class`
* `length` or `dim`
* `dimnames`
* `attributes`
* `str`
* `args` on a function

# Data Analysis Workflow

* RStudio setup
* Maintain a clean environment
  * No restoring `.RData`
  * Never save workspace on exit
* Top to bottom RMarkdown
* Import data (usually)
* Clean
    * subset / filter
* Reshape (wide / long)
* summarize / aggregate
* visually explore (EDA)
* graph
  * ggplot2
  * baseR
  * lattice
* Generate the report
  * `knit`ting the document
